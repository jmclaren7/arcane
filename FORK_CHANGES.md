# Fork changes (jcs-next)

This file is the authoritative list of changes that set this fork
(`jmclaren7/arcane`, branch `jcs-next`) apart from upstream
(`getarcaneapp/arcane`, branch `main`). It is written to be used by a human
or an AI agent when **rebasing onto a newer upstream or re-applying these
changes**.

When you rebase, work through every entry below. For each one:

1. Check whether upstream has since implemented an equivalent fix. If it has,
   **drop** the fork change and move it to "Dropped / now upstream" with a note.
2. Otherwise re-apply it, adapting to any code that moved. Re-run the listed
   verification.
3. Keep this file in sync: update the "Last rebased onto" marker, and move
   entries between the "Active" and "Dropped" sections as upstream evolves.

> **Last rebased onto upstream:** `b501c49` — _fix: skip SMTP auth without full
> credentials and add none auth mode (#3192)_, on 2026-07-07.

## Active changes

### 1. "About this fork" README banner

- **Files:** `README.md`
- **What:** Prepend a blockquoted "About this fork" section above upstream's
  README that explains this is a dev fork, points at `FORK_CHANGES.md`, and
  lists the published image names/tags.
- **Why:** Makes the fork's purpose and image locations obvious to anyone who
  lands on the repo, and links to the change list.
- **Re-apply notes:** Insert the block immediately before upstream's first
  README line (`<div align="center">`). Keep the one-sentence summary of
  carried changes in sync with the Active list below (drop mentions of any
  change that moves to "Dropped").
- **Redundancy check:** Upstream README has no fork banner — **keep**.

### 2. Set background early to prevent white flash

- **Files:** `frontend/src/app.html`
- **What:** Inject an inline `<style>` (light/dark `html` background +
  `color-scheme`) and a small bootstrap `<script>` that reads the persisted
  `mode-watcher-mode` (default `system`), toggles the `dark` class on `<html>`
  and sets `colorScheme` before hydration.
- **Why:** Eliminates the flash of incorrect theme on first paint.
- **Re-apply notes:** Insert the block right after the two `theme-color`
  `<meta>` tags, before `%sveltekit.head%`. The oklch values must match
  upstream's `theme-color` metas (currently `oklch(1 0 0)` light /
  `oklch(0.141 0.005 285.823)` dark). Depends on `mode-watcher` and its
  `mode-watcher-mode` localStorage key — confirm both still exist
  (`mode-watcher` in `frontend/package.json`).
- **Redundancy check:** Upstream `app.html` still has no early-background
  handling (only the two `theme-color` metas) — **keep**.

### 3. Preinstall Bun in the dev Dockerfile

- **Files:** `docker/Dockerfile.dev`
- **What:** In the `frontend-dev` stage, `apt-get install ca-certificates curl
  unzip`, install Bun, and symlink it to `/usr/local/bin/bun`.
- **Why:** `pnpm check` runs `svelte-check-rs`, which shells out to Bun and
  tries to auto-install it; the slim Node image lacks curl/unzip so the
  auto-install fails.
- **Re-apply notes:** Add the `RUN` block right after the
  `FROM ... AS frontend-dev` line. Keep the Node base image tag in sync with
  upstream (currently `node:26-trixie-slim`).
- **Redundancy check:** `svelte-check-rs` is still the `check` script in
  `frontend/package.json` and upstream's `frontend-dev` stage still omits Bun
  (the `ca-certificates`/`curl` install lives in the separate `backend-dev`
  stage, not the frontend one) — **keep**.

### 4. Exclude nested build artifacts from the Docker build context

- **Files:** `.dockerignore`
- **What:** Add recursive `**/node_modules`, `**/build`, `**/.svelte-kit`
  alongside the existing top-level entries.
- **Why:** Nested workspace folders were copied into the build context and
  caused build failures (e.g. on Windows, where the bundled modules differed).
- **Redundancy check:** Upstream added some recursive media/test patterns
  (`**/*.test.js`, `**/.DS_Store`, `**/*.mp4`), but the build-artifact entries
  `node_modules`, `build`, and `.svelte-kit` are still top-level only —
  **keep**.

### 5. Expand contributor dev docs

- **Files:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **What:** Split Prerequisites into Required (Docker) and Optional (host
  tools for the Justfile shortcuts: `just`, `pnpm`/Node, Go 1.26+,
  `golangci-lint`, with a Windows `winget` one-liner); clarify that Justfile
  recipes run on the host, not in the dev containers; and expand "Manual
  Commands" into three options (Justfile, `dev.sh shell`, and one-shot
  `docker compose exec` with `-p arcane-dev` + `pnpm -C frontend`).
- **Why:** Upstream's Prerequisites say only "Docker & Docker Compose (that's
  it! 🎉)", so contributors who use the Justfile shortcuts or run checks
  manually hit missing host tools or the wrong Compose project name.
- **Re-apply notes:** The patch anchors on the `### Prerequisites`,
  `### Justfile Shortcuts`, and `### Manual Commands` headings. Confirm the dev
  script path (`./scripts/development/dev.sh`) and the Compose project name
  (`arcane-dev`) still match before re-applying.
- **Redundancy check:** Upstream `CONTRIBUTING.md` Prerequisites still read
  "Docker & Docker Compose (that's it! 🎉)" with no optional-tools guidance —
  **keep**.

### 6. CI/workflows adapted for this fork

- **Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/build-next-images.yml`
- **Intent:** Make CI run on a fork without upstream-only
  infrastructure:
  - Run on the `jcs-next` branch (CI on push/PR; next images on push to
    `jcs-next`).
  - Use standard `ubuntu` runners instead of `depot-*` runners; use
    `docker/setup-qemu-action` + `docker/setup-buildx-action` instead of the
    depot buildx driver.
  - Drop steps that need secrets/licenses unavailable on forks: GoReleaser Pro
    release, cosign signing, depot test reporting.
  - Drop the `deadcode` and `cli-e2e-tests` jobs (gated on the `getarcaneapp`
    owner / depot secrets).
  - Build & push with `docker/build-push-action` to
    `ghcr.io/<owner>/arcane` and `ghcr.io/<owner>/arcane-agent` (tag `next`),
    dropping the upstream `manager`/`arcane-headless`/`agent` image
    names/aliases and the `linux/arm/v7` + `linux/riscv64` targets (fork
    builds `linux/amd64,linux/arm64` only).
- **Re-apply notes:** This is the highest-churn area on rebase — upstream
  frequently rewrites these workflows. Re-derive from upstream's **new**
  workflow files and re-apply the transformations above, rather than
  force-keeping the fork's stale copies, so upstream CI improvements are picked
  up. (For `ci.yml`, a 3-way cherry-pick of the fork's CI commit onto the new
  upstream `ci.yml` cleanly carries the fork's removals while inheriting
  upstream's pin bumps; `build-next-images.yml` is a wholesale fork rewrite, so
  re-derive it by hand and only sync upstream's action pins into it.) Keep
  action/toolchain pins in sync with upstream (currently node 26,
  `actions/checkout@v7.0.0`, `golangci-lint-action@v9.3.0`, `actions/cache@v6.1.0`,
  `docker/login-action@v4.4.0`). The fork intentionally keeps the agent image
  named `arcane-agent` (not upstream's `arcane-headless`) because it reads
  better when the repo owner is not "Arcane"; preserve published image names so
  existing pullers don't break.
- **Redundancy check:** Upstream still relies on depot/GoReleaser/cosign — its
  `ci.yml` still uses `depot-*` runners, Depot CLI/test reporting, and the
  `deadcode` + `cli-e2e-tests` jobs, and `build-next-images.yml` still uses
  depot, `arcane-headless`, and `linux/arm/v7`. The fork adaptation is still
  required. **keep.**
- **Out of scope:** `build-pr-images.yml` and `release.yml` are left at
  upstream — the fork has never customised them.

## Dropped / now upstream

Changes the fork used to carry that upstream has since implemented (do **not**
re-introduce them):

- **Sanitize discovered project names** *(was Active #1:
  `project_service.go`, `project_service_test.go`)* — upstream reworked
  `upsertProjectForDir`. New projects are now created with
  `Name: composeMetadata.resolvedProjectName`, where `resolvedProjectName`
  defaults to `projects.NormalizeProjectName(dirName)` (compose-go
  normalization → `[a-z0-9_-]`, a subset of the editor-accepted
  `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`). Existing rows self-heal on sync in the same function via
  `NormalizeProjectName(existing.Name) != existing.Name`. This covers both
  halves of the fork change (a valid `Name` on discovery **and** self-healing
  existing invalid names), so the fork's `SanitizeProjectName` patch and its
  tests are redundant. At the 2.0.x rebase upstream still seeded
  `Name: dirName` unsanitised, which is why this was Active then.
  _Dropped at the 2026-07-07 rebase onto `b501c49`._
- **Keep LF line endings for scripts** *(was Active #5: `.gitattributes`)* —
  upstream now ships its own `.gitattributes` forcing `eol=lf` for `*.sh`
  (plus `.husky/*`, `.husky/_/*`, `Justfile`), which covers the real concern
  (bash shebangs broken by Windows `autocrlf`). The fork's `*.bash` rule
  matched no files in the tree. The only rule upstream lacks is
  `Dockerfile text eol=lf`; modern BuildKit tolerates CRLF in Dockerfiles, so
  this residual is marginal and was not re-added. If it's ever wanted, append
  that single line to upstream's `.gitattributes` rather than re-adding the
  fork's own file (which would conflict). _Dropped at the 2026-07-07 rebase
  onto `b501c49`._
- **User avatar 404 when no email is set** *(was: `sidebar-user.svelte`)* —
  upstream's `getGravatarUrl` now returns `''` early for a falsy email, so the
  Gravatar 404 no longer occurs. The fork's `&& user?.email` guard is redundant.
  _Dropped at the 2.0.x rebase (2026-06-13)._
- **Toast on project form validation failure** *(was part of the project-name
  fix, `projects/[projectId]/+page.svelte`)* — upstream's `handleSaveChanges`
  now shows `toast.error(m.templates_validation_error())` via its own
  `hasAnyErrors` guard before the silent `if (!validated) return`, so the extra
  toast would be duplicative. _Dropped at the 2.0.x rebase (2026-06-13)._
